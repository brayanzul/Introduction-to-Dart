List: It is basically in another language known as arrays, but in Dart they are Lists.

Map: Used to store key/value pairs.

Functions in Dart: Functions in Dart behave
as first-class objects, which means that they can be stored in a variable, passed as an argument, or returned, like a normal function return value.

![Classe-Dart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62777613/205458042-9f8be7e2-95f9-4d0c-8d6e-c5d1a68ae68a.png)

Classes in Dart: It is an object-oriented language with classes and inheritance based, with each object being an instance of a class.

Conatractors: They are the methods that are created when creating an instance of the class, in simpler words, the default main method.

Getters and Setters are class methods that are used to manipulate data in class fields.

- Getters: It is used to read or obtain the class field data.

- Setters: It is used to set the data of the class field in some variable.

![Clases-Abstracta](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62777613/205708133-3492b556-49d5-45ae-9256-3cb6e611030d.png)

Abstract Classes: An abstract class in Dart is defined as those classes that contain one or more than one abstract method.

Extends: The objective of inheritance is to allow us to reuse, extend or change the behavior of 
an existing class called superClass, in new classes, called derived or child classes, in Dart we 
can inherit from a single class, but inheritance is transitive.
